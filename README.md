# Description

This python script automatically generates a BibTeX file from the citations exported from the [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/) database. You can use bib files to upload on platforms that support the conduction of empirical studies (e.g. [Thoth](http://200.132.136.13/Thoth/)) or to edit scientific papers (e.g. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)).

# How to use
 
1. Export citations from Springerlink database as csv file based on your search string results.

2. Copy and paste DOIs column from csv file to a txt file.

3. Add the python script and the DOI file in the same directory.

4. Run command line: python springerlink_bibtex_converter.py file_input.txt file_output.bib
